The successful implementation of the Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) at Perundurai by Exim Knits Private
Limited, particularly its robust Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) system, provides a valuable blueprint for
scaling similar initiatives across the water-intensive textile sector. However, expanding such complex
environmental infrastructure demands a strategic approach that integrates past learnings and addresses
potential challenges in restarting or re-envisioning projects.

Scaling Projects:
To improve water management in India's dyeing industry, it's fundamental to expand the ETP model,
similar to Exim Knits' cluster-based approach, by setting up shared treatment plants in other textile
areas like Ahmedabad, Jaipur, and Surat, customizing them to local needs. This involves upgrading
treatment systems with advanced technologies such as RO, MEE, ultrafiltration, and nanofiltration to
recover cleaner water for industrial reuse. Beyond water, a focus on Comprehensive Resource Recovery
will involve extracting valuable salts from concentrated wastewater and exploring energy recovery from
organic matter, fostering a more circular economy. Furthermore, implementing Effluent Reuse and
Closed-Loop Systems with dedicated pipelines will facilitate direct water recycling within dyeing units,
drastically cutting fresh water intake and wastewater discharge. Lastly, Urban Integration will
strategically direct treated effluent to municipal systems for non-drinking uses, like watering parks or
washing streets, thereby helping to conserve potable water supplies for broader urban management.

Scaling complex ZLD projects is not without its challenges, and insights from existing implementations
are crucial:
1Water treatment is essential in the textile industry due to its high water usage and discharge of
chemically contaminated effluents, which can severely impact the environment if not properly
managed. Scaling up towards Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) is vital to meet regulatory standards, enhance
water reuse, and promote sustainability. Advanced technologies like Membrane Bioreactors (MBR) offer
high-quality biological treatment with smaller footprints, while Agitated Thin Film Dryers (ATFD)
effectively handle concentrated waste streams by evaporating remaining moisture from brine.
Integrating such technologies with RO, MEE, and other ZLD components, along with sustainable sludge
management, financial planning, and stakeholder collaboration, ensures successful and scalable water
treatment solutions in the textile sector.
